# Deviate - DLL Inject Example

This example demonstrates how **deviate** can be used in a DLL in order to detour  
a function away from it's original behaviour.


#### Intended Usage
1. Compile the target and payload binaries
2. Run the target and observe it's runtime behaviour
3. Inject the payload into the target process
4. Observe and verify the new behaviour of the target process.
